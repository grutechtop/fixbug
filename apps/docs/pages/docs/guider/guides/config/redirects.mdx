# Redirects

Sometimes, you want to redirect from a link to a page. For example, redirecting from `/docs` to an actual page like `/docs/getting-started`.

Next.JS does not provide an easy way if you render as a static site. So Guider has a simple tool to orchestrate redirects.

## Creating a redirect

The `createRedirect` function can make a page that simply redirects to another page.
So for example above, you would make a `docs/index.mdx` file with the following:

```ts title="docs/index.mdx"
import { createRedirect } from '@neato/guider/client'

export default createRedirect({ to: '/docs/getting-started' });
```

<Tip>
Some hosting platforms like Netlify or Cloudflare Pages can give you more control over redirects with a `_redirects` file.<br/>
This is preferable over `createRedirect` since it uses HTTP redirection instead of Javascript.
