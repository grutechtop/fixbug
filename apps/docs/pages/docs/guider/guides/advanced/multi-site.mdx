# Running multiple sites

Managing big documentation sites or multiple at a time can be a challenge. On this page we talk about
the challenges and how to overcome them.


## The basics of running multiple sites

Before we go over recommended techniques, let's first introduce the main method
on how to configure these sites.

Sites in Guider don't neccesarily have completely seperate entities. Anything that is customized
beyond just the contents of the sidebar is a new site. Think of sites as just a new instance of a Guider site.

A good use case of when to use a different site is if you want to have different content in the navigation header.

---

Making new sites in Guider is thankfully very easy. Instead of just putting in one site configuration, you can enter an array:

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { site, defineTheme } from "@neato/guider/theme"

export default defineTheme([
  site('site-a', {...}), // [!code focus]
  site('site-b', {...}), // [!code focus]
])
```


## Site templates

When you have many different sites that are mostly similar, it can be very verbose to reconfigure every site with the same settings.

That is where site templates come in: you can make a template and any site can use a template as its base.

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { site, link, defineTheme, siteTemplate } from "@neato/guider/theme"

const base = siteTemplate({
  navigation: [
    link("Example link", "/example"),
  ]
})

export default defineTheme([
  site("site-a", {
    extends: [base],
    // ... other settings go here ...
  })
])
```

You can provide multiple sites to extend from, they are merged in order of how they are passed in.

<Warning>
  Arrays in template sites are overwritten completely and do not get merged together.
  The only exception to this is layouts, all layouts are included in the final result.
</Warning>


## Recommended folder structure

Folder structure of your pages directory is completely flexible and up to the writer's choice.
However, below we have some recommendations for bigger projects.

1. **Reserve a space for non-documentation:** It's likely that big documentation sites will expand slightly outside of purely documentation.
Think showcases, contact page, brand information. So it's wise to put your documentation on `/docs` so you can put everything else outside of it.
2. **Put your concepts all on one level:** When you have multiple concepts like a list of libraries or a list of applications. You should put all of them
in the same level. For example, for library `shoejs`, `jacketjs` and `sockdotnet`. You would have folders: `/docs/shoejs`, `/docs/jacketjs` and `docs/sockdotnet`.
Do not group them as `/docs/libs/xxx` or `/docs/apps/xxx`, it will only make it harder to find in your project structure with less predictable URLs.
3. **Have a `_meta.json` file at the root of every concept:** you should have a `_meta.json` file containing common configuration per concept.
Following the previous examples, put one at `/docs/shoejs/_meta.json`. with `{ "site": "shoejs" }{:json}`.
4. **Have a `theme.config.tsx` file at the root of every concept:** to prevent your site configuration from being gigantic, you can split it up per concept.
Create a theme config that just exports the single `site(...)` instance for that concept. At the top level `theme.config.tsx`, you can import them all and just add them to the `defineTheme()`

To combine everything, here is the example folder structure from all the examples:
```sh
theme.config.tsx
pages/
├── index.mdx
├── contact.mdx
└── docs/
    ├── shoejs/
    │   ├── _meta.json
    │   ├── theme.config.tsx
    │   ├── index.mdx
    │   ├── getting-started/
    │   │   ├── install.mdx
    │   │   ├── features.mdx
    │   │   └── examples.mdx
    │   └── usage/
    │       ├── basics.mdx
    │       ├── advanced.mdx
    │       └── contributing.mdx
    ├── jacketjs/
    │   ├── _meta.json
    │   ├── theme.config.tsx
    │   ├── index.mdx
    │   ├── getting-started/

    │       ├── advanced.mdx
    │       └── contributing.mdx
    └── sockdotnet/
        ├── _meta.json
        ├── theme.config.tsx
        ├── index.mdx
        ├── getting-started/
        │   ├── install.mdx
        │   ├── features.mdx
        │   └── examples.mdx
        └── usage/
            ├── basics.mdx
            ├── advanced.mdx
            └── contributing.mdx
