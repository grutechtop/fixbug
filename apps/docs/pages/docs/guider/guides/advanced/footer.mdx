# Footer

Learn about configuring the two kinds of footers.


## The two footers

Let's get the confusion out of the way first. There are two kinds of footers:
1. **Content footer:** This is the footer that is placed right below your content and doesn't go below the sidebar or table of contents.
2. **Page footer:** This footer is placed below everything, even under the content footer if you have both enabled.


## Configuring the content footer

The content footer can hold 3 things:
- An "Edit this page on GitHub" link.
- Social links. Supported types: `slack`, `discord`, `x`, `mastodon`, `github`.
- Some text, by default it's a copyright notice.

Here is an example of how to configure all of these, keep in mind that all fields are optional.

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
import { site, social } from "@neato/guider/theme"

site('site-a', {
  contentFooter: {
    socials: [
      social.x("https://x.com/"),
      social.discord("https://discord.gg/"),
    ],
    text: "Made with <3",

    // edit repository base must point to the folder that the guider project is in. (same folder as the package.json)
    // If it's in the root of the repository, make sure the url ends with /tree/BRANCHNAME
    editRepositoryBase: "https://github.com/mrjvs/neatojs/tree/dev/apps/docs"
  }
})
```

Content footer is enabled by default, but in case you've customized it. It can be disabled/enabled even if you have the settings configured.
This can be done on any settings layout. Read more about [layout settings](/docs/guider/guides/config/theming#introduction-to-layout-settings) if you want.

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
site('main', {
  settings: {
    contentFooter: true,
  }
})
```


## Configuring the page footer

The page footer can only hold text. However it is very easy to replace the footer with something custom. Read more about [customizing layout](/docs/guider/guides/advanced/customizing-layout).

Here is an example of how to configure the text:

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
import { site } from "@neato/guider/theme"

site('site-a', {
  pageFooter: {
    text: 'Made with <3',
  }
})
```

**Page footer is disabled by default.** It will be disabled until explicitly enabled in the layout settings. Read more about [layout settings](/docs/guider/guides/config/theming#introduction-to-layout-settings) if you want.

```tsx title="theme.config.tsx"
site('site-a', {
  settings: {
    pageFooter: true,
  }
})
```
