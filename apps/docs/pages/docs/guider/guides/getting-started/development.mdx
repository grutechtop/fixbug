# Development

This guide goes over some tips to get the optimal developer experience for writing your documentation.


## Running the development server

After you've gone through the installation process, all you need to do get up and running is
run the dev script with your favourite package manager. For an example with NPM:

```sh
npm run dev
```

<Note>
The Next.JS development server is infamous for being slow. The final build of the site will be **much** faster.
</Note>


## Building for production

To build your production build, you can run `npm run build{:sh}` (or use your favourite package manager).

This will create a folder called `out` that holds the final build that's ready for deployment.

If you want to preview it, you can run `npx run serve out` to spin up a temporary HTTP server that serves the `out` folder.


## Autocomplete and syntax highlighting for MDX files

By default, most code editors will not support MDX files. To add support, you can install the MDX extensions:
  - For JetBrains editors, you can use the JetBrains maintained [MDX plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx).
  - For VSCode, you can install the [MDX extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) maintained by the MDX team.
