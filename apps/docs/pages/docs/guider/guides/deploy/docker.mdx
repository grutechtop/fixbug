# Docker

A Dockerfile to build a Guider documentation site container.


## The code

Add the following code to a file called `Dockerfile`. **It has to be in the same location as your package.json.**

If you're running a monorepo or using private packages, this file won't help. You'll be on your own to figure it out.
Also if you're using a different package manager, you'll have to change the file to use your specific manager.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM node:20-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . ./
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:1.25-alpine as run
EXPOSE 80
RUN cat > /etc/nginx/nginx.conf << EOF
server {
  listen 80;

  location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    try_files $uri /404.html;
  }
}
EOF
COPY --from=build /app/out /usr/share/nginx/html
```
