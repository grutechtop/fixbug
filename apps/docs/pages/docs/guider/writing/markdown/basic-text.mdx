# Basic text

Learn the basics of Markdown through this simple guide.


## Paragraphs

Writing paragraphs in markdown is very easy, you just write a line of text.

If you want to start a new paragraph, make sure you add **two** newlines instead of one.

```md
This is the first paragraph.

And this is the second paragraph!
```


## Titles

```md
# Page title

## Section title

### Subtitle
```

<Tip>
  All Section titles show up in the Table of Contents on the right.

## Text formatting

Almost all markdown formatting is supported in Guider, simply wrap your text in the appropiate symbols.

| Formatting    | Markdown down            | Result                 |
|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Bold          | `**Bold**`               | **Bold**               |
| Italic        | `_Italic_`               | _Italic_               |
| Strikethrough | `~Strikethrough~`        | ~Strikethrough~        |
| Superscript   | `<sup>Superscript</sup>` | <sup>Superscript</sup> |
| Subscript     | `<sub>Subscript</sub>`   | <sub>Subscript</sub>   |

You can combine multiple styles. For example `**_Bold and italic_**` to get **_Bold and italic_**.


## Linking to other pages

You can link to other pages simply by wrapping your text in `[]()`. For example, to link to an external website you would write `[Example](https://example.com)` which would look like
this: [Example](https://example.com).

If you need to link to other internal pages you can write `[Link text](../page-a)` or the full path: `[link text](/docs/page-b)`.
