# Lists

Lists in Markdown are very easy to write, they are essential in writing organised content.

## Ordered list

To write an ordered list, add a number with a dot after it followed by your text.
Note that you don't have to make the numbers be in order, Guider will make it be in order for you.

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three

```md
1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
```

## Unordered list

To write an unordered list, add a dashes, followed by your text. Alternatively you can use any of these characters instead as prefix: `-`, `*`, `+`

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

```md
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
```

## Nesting lists

To make lists indented, you add extra spaces or tabs into the nested lists. Just make sure that they align vertically and they will nest automatically.
- Item one
- Item two
  - Item two/one
  - Item two/two
- Item three

```md
- Item one
- Item two
  - Item two/one
  - Item two/two
- Item three
```
