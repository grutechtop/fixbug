# Code blocks

If you're writing technical documentation, code blocks are essential. This is why Guider code blocks are jam-packed with features.


## Basic code block

Code blocks are very easy to write in Markdown. Simply wrap your code in 3 backticks (```) in front and 3 after.
Optionally you can specify a programming language directly after the first 3 backticks for the code to be syntax highlighted.

```js
console.log("hello world")
```

````md
```js
console.log("hello world")
```
````

In Guider, the programming language is shown top right of the codeblock. Hovering over a codeblock will show a copy button.

<Note>
For syntax highlighting, we make use of [Shiki](https://shiki.style/guide/). You can find a list of [supported languages here](https://shiki.style/languages).
</Note>


## Inline code

In the case where you want to display single line of code inside of a normal paragraph, instead of an entire code block.
You can use inline code blocks.

Simply wrap `some text` in backticks (`)

```md
Simply wrap `some text` in backticks (`)
```

To add syntax highlighting for a programming language to your inline codeblock. You can end your inline code with `{:LANGUAGE}{:txt}`.

For example this line of javascript (js): `import hello from "world";{:js}`.

```md
For example this line of javascript (js): `import hello from "world";{:js}`.
```


## Titled code blocks

You can add a title to a codeblock by simply adding the annotation `title="my-file.txt"`. The double quotes are required.

```js title="index.js"
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
}
```

````md
```js title="index.js"
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
}
```
````


## Line numbers

To add line numbers to your code block, add the attribute `showLineNumbers` to your code block.

```js showLineNumbers
function test() {
  console.log("hello world")
}
```

````md
```js showLineNumbers
function test() {
  console.log("hello world")
}
```
````


## Highlight words

To highlight specific words or phrases, add the `/xxx/` annotation to your code block.
```js /hello/
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world")
}
```

````md
```js /hello/
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world")
}
```
````

In the case that you want to start highlighting at a specific point and not everything. You can add a comment with `[!code word:xxx]`.
If you want it to highlight multiple, you can specify an amount like so: `[!code word:xxx:3]` (it won't count on the line itself).

```js
// [!code word:hello:2]
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
  console.log("another hello world");
}
```

````md
```js
// [\!code word:hello:2]
// make sure to remove the slash in this example before copying
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
  console.log("another hello world");
}
```
````


## Highlight lines

At times, highlighting entire lines can be useful. There are a handful of choices here:
- `// [\!code --]` - mark line as removed
- `// [\!code ++]` - mark line as added
- `// [\!code highlight]` - highlight line
- `// [\!code error]` - show an error background on the line
- `// [\!code warning]` - show an warning background on the line

You can add this at the end of any line of code in your code block to apply the style to the line. **Make sure to remove the slash from the examples**.

```js

console.log("Removed line"); // [!code --]

console.log("Added line"); // [!code ++]

console.log("Highlighted line"); // [!code highlight]

console.log("Error on line"); // [!code error]

console.log("Warning on line"); // [!code warning]

```

If you want to apply line highlighting to multiple lines, you can also add it as an annotation `{1,3-5}`. This will apply to line 1 and the range 3 until 5 (inclusive)

```js {1,3-5}
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
  console.log("another hello world");

  cool();
  return 42;
}
```

````md
```js {1,3-5}
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
  console.log("another hello world");

  cool();
  return 42;
}
```
````


## Focus lines

When you have a bunch of code for completeness, but most of it is not relevant to the example. You have the option to focus only the lines you want.
Simply add `[!code focus]` in a comment at the end of your lines that you want to focus.

```js
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world"); // [!code focus]
  console.log("another hello world"); // [!code focus]
}
```

````md
```js
// make sure to remove the slashes in this example before copying
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world"); // [\!code focus]
  console.log("another hello world"); // [\!code focus]
}
```
````


## NPM integration

A nice little utility provided by The Guild called [`@theguild/remark-npm2yarn`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theguild/remark-npm2yarn) can
help you show your NPM install command in other package managers.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @neato/guider
```

````md
```sh npm2yarn
npm install @neato/guider
```
````

<Caution>
This only works with `npm install` commands, not any other subset of commands like `npx` or `npm run`
</Caution>
