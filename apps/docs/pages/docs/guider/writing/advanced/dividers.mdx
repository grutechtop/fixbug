# Dividers

Learn how to add divider lines to your documentation.

## The syntax

Dividers can be a nice way to section up your content outside of just headings. Thankfully markdown has a very easy syntax to make dividers.

If you add three or more asterisks (`***`), dashes (`---`) or underscores (`___`). A divider will appear.

<Frame>
<div style={{ width: '100%' }}>

Some text

---

More text
___

Even more text

***

Final text
</div>
</Frame>

```md
Some text

---

More text
___

Even more text

***

Final text
```

<Caution>
Make sure to add blank lines around a divider. If a divider is directly under a paragraph, the paragraph will be interpreted as a heading.
