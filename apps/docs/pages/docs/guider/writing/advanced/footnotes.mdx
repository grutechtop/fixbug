# Footnotes

Learn how to add footnotes to your documentation.

## The syntax

You can add footnotes to your page with a bracket syntax. Add `[^1]{:md}` somewhere in your text, and somewhere else you can add a line `[^1]: My reference{:md}` to add content to the footnote.

The position of the footnote does not matter, it is always shown at the bottom of your page.
