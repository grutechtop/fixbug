# Tables

Tables are useful to display structured data.


## Basic table

Tables in Guider use the standard [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables). You can use any inline styling
inside of tables such as inline code, bolding and italics.

| Name     | Hobby                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| John     | Ultimate Frisbee                        |
| Jane     | Building Guitars                        |
| Mark     | Experimenting with very wet bread dough |

```md
| Name     | Hobby                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| John     | Ultimate Frisbee                        |
| Jane     | Building Guitars                        |
| Mark     | Experimenting with very wet bread dough |
```

You can make cell widths different sizes, the output will be the same:

```md
| Name | Hobby |
| --- | --- |
| John | Ultimate Frisbee |
| Jane | Building Guitars |
| Mark | Experimenting with very wet bread dough |
```

<Tip>
Need to use the pipe symbol (`|`) inside your table? Prefix it with a backslash (`\`) to make it count as cell content instead of a divider.
</Tip>

## Empty headers

Table headers in markdown are required, but if you leave them completely empty (only spaces). Guider will hide the header row for you.

|          |                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| John     | Ultimate Frisbee                   |
| Jane     | Building Guitars                   |
| Mark     | Experimenting very wet bread dough |

```md
|          |                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| John     | Ultimate Frisbee                   |
| Jane     | Building Guitars                   |
| Mark     | Experimenting very wet bread dough |
```


## Alignment

You can align the contents of a column in a specific direction by adding a colon (`:`) to the left, right or both sides of the hyphens in the header row.

| Left  | Center | Right |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| Lorem | Ipsum  | Dolor |
| Sit   | Samet  | Elit  |

```md
| Left  | Center | Right |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| Lorem | Ipsum  | Dolor |
| Sit   | Samet  | Elit  |
```
