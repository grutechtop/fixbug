# Why use `@neato/config`

- Load from multiple file formats (`.env`, `.json`).
- Load from environment variables.
- Allows for nested configuration.
- Type-safe through Zod's or joi's schema validation.
- Combine many sources into one configuration object.
- Partial presets through premade configuration fragments.
- Naming agnostic, use any naming convention.
- Freeze your configuration, prevent it from being changed at runtime.
